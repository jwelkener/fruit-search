Fruit Search - by John Welkener

I am completing this project for the Springboard Software Engineering Bootcamp. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I will build a search bar that auto-completes with the names of fruit while the user is typing their input. 

Target skills include:
 - DOM manipulation
 - advanced array methods
 - ES2015
